		<p id="story1" class="hide">There once was a lonely man who lived in a house. One day, he heard a <span id="s1-adjective1">loud</span> noise coming from the basement. He <span  id="s1-verb1">walked</span> to the basement door, to see what the noise was. When he <span id="s1-verb2">looked</span> down the stairwell, he saw a(n) <span  id="s1-adjective2">scary</span> <span id="s1-noun1">ghost</span>. Frightened, the man ran away, calling for his <span id="s1-noun2">teddy bear</span>. The end.</p>
		<p id="story2" class="hide">Once upon a time, there were two <span id="s2-adjective1">happy</span> spirits. One spirit <span id="s2-verb1">looked</span> to the other and said, "Have you seen my <span id="s2-noun1">book</span>?" "I haven't", the second spirit lied as he <span id="s2-verb2">ran</span> down the road. "Instead, why don't you take my <span id="s2-adjective2">red</span> <span id="s2-noun2">pen</span>?" The first spirit took a moment to reply. Finally he said, "Okay, I will." The end.</p>
