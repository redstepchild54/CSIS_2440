						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>My name is William McConnell, but most people who aren’t asking me to fill out forms know me as Bill. I am a mid-20s Utah native with a passion for nerd culture. I have a broad amount of life experience as a programmer, jazz drummer, <span onclick="playAudio('distances')">cross-country runner</span>, stage actor, dungeon master, student, and husband. I am working towards my bachelor’s degree in computer science from Weber State University with an associate’s degree from Salt Lake Community College.</p>
						<p>Those that have seen me recently have noted my long, curly, red hair and its resemblance to <span onclick="playAudio('telleverything')">Faramir’s</span>, from the Lord of the Rings films. I believe this to be an apt comparison because I also would like my father to think better of me. In all reality, my parents are wonderful and have been extremely supportive of my journey in becoming an adult. I owe a lot to them, as I wouldn’t be who I am today without their guidance.</p>
						<p>I would say that I am a very positive person as I enjoy seeing the beauty in life. While I enjoy most things, I usually prefer to enjoy them in the comfort of my own home. I am a home body who enjoys spending time with friends and family, playing board games or watching movies, as opposed to going out for a night on the town. That being said, my wonderful wife, Caroline, pushes me outside of my comfort zone by having us go out for a myriad of activities. Most of my favorite life experiences would not have happened if not for her. Like my parents, she has helped shape who I am. I would say that it has been for the better.</p>

						<h2>Work/Career</h2>
						<p>Over the years, I have had many jobs ranging from bagging groceries at 16, running a summer sports camp for kids at 19, providing IT support for a furniture store at 20, and now, at 26 providing L3 technical support for a learning management software company. I currently work for Instructure in the Customer Service department. Ever since I could work, I have been involved with customers directly. During my time in IT and as an L3, my co-workers are my customers.</p>
						<p>Some would call me a workaholic because, besides my bed, work is where I choose to spend most of my time. While some people view their jobs as just a means to pay the bills, I view my workplace opportunities as a career. I truly love going into work everyday and seeing my co-workers sparks joy.</p>
						<p>Using the skills that I am learning from Salt Lake Community College and Weber State University, I hope to one day have a software engineering career. I love the idea of being able to program on a daily basis, whether that programming is in the form of database management, quality assurance, front-end, or back-end programming. I am excited at the prospect of being able to design, build, and troubleshoot for a living. Some jobs might be repetitive and dull, but programming is fantastic because every day is a new challenge. </p>

						<h2>Hobbies</h2>
						<p>When I am not working or going to school, I like to have fun in my free time. The majority of my hobbies include electronic entertainment and activities that I can do with my friends. These include:</p>
						<ul>
								<li>Video Games</li>
								<li>Movies</li>
								<li>Dungeons and Dragons</li>
								<li>Board/Tabletop Games</li>
						</ul>
						<p>One of my favorite hobbies is role playing tabletop games, like <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons">D&amp;D.</abbr> I have played many campaigns using many different systems. I am a huge fan of the most recent version of D&amp;D (5<sup>th</sup> edition) as it is really easy for beginners. If you want to learn more, you can go to <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&amp;D Beyond</a> for more details. Below are a list of games and characters that I have played.</p>

						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>Taking the CSIS 1430: Introduction to Web Programming course has been one of the best college experiences that I have had at Salt Lake Community College. The programming skills that I have learned in this class are truly invaluable as they directly pertain to what I am passionate about. Web development is apparent everywhere as all of us utilize the internet. Pulling back the curtain and being able to see how websites function and are designed is amazing.</p>
						<p>When taking this course, I was hoping to develop skills that could help me program either personal or professional websites. This was the perfect introduction to those topics. Over the course of this class, we learned how to program in: HTML to structure a webpage, CSS to format a webpage, and JavaScript to make a webpage dynamic. All of these skills were taught expertly, and I feel that my understanding of these subjects has grown tremendously from taking this class.</p>
						<p>After this class is finished, I will use the skills that I have developed to build personal projects and hopefully gain employment in the software development industry. This has been a goal of mine since starting College, and this class has offered one of the biggest steps forward toward that goal. I am so thankful to Jeff, my professor, and SLCC for teaching such a wonderful course and giving me a fantastic opportunity to learn so many cool things. </p>
						<p>In all, I would recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in learning web development, programming, or just wants more information about how a website works in general. I have had a phenomenal experience in this class, and every other student has that same opportunity.</p>
