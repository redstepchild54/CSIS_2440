			<h1>About Bill's Best Pizza</h1>
			<p><img class="whitehouse" src="img/whitehouse-pizza.jpg" alt="whitehouse eating pizza">Bill's Best Pizza has been open for two decades. It all started when a hungry six-year-old had a dream of making beautiful delicious pizzas. Bill, the six-year-old founder bought an office in his parents basement between the couch and the coffee table. There, he prepared a variety of pizzas with only the freshest of plastic ingredients. Although he had a small start and faced a multitude of challenges along the way to the top, Bill built a pizza empire that rivaled Italy itself. The president of the United States of America has gone on record saying, "Bill's Best Pizza is the best! It started here in America. America has the best things. America has the best Pizza. Bill has the best pizza."</p>
